# ComSpat

R functions for analyzing the ‘within-**Com**munity **Spat**ial organization’ of
species combinations to model plant species co-occurrence patterns as a function
of increasing sampling resolution.

## Description

We present ComSpat, a new R package that uses grid or transect data sets to measure
the number of realized (observed) species combinations (NRC) and the Shannon diversity
of realized species combinations (compositional diversity; CD) as a function of
spatial scale. NRC and CD represent two measures from a model family developed
by Pál Juhász-Nagy based on Information Theory (see Juhász-Nagy, 1967, 1976,
1984a, 1984b, 1993; Juhász-Nagy & Podani, 1983).

To assist users in detecting and interpreting spatial associations and infering
assembly mechanisms, ComSpat offers complete spatial randomness and random shift
null models, which assists users to disentangle the textural, intraspecific, and
interspecific effects on the observed spatial patterns. Our open-sourced package
provides a vignette that describes the method and reproduces the figures from this
paper to help users contextualize and apply functions to their data. 

For any questions, comments or bug reports please submit an issue here on GitHub.
Suggestions, ideas and references of new algorithms are always welcome.

## News

* July-2021: Version 1.0 is available from GitHub.

## Main functionalities

* Calculates two information theory models based on species combinations as
a function of spatial scale, specifically;
  * the number of realized (observed) species combinations (NRC)
  * the Shannon diversity of realized species combinations (Compositional Diversity; CD)
* Allows for the application of null models:
  * complete spatial randomness (CSR) helps to show the combined effects of 
  individual species level spatial aggregations and interspecific associations
  on observed (realized) coexistence relationships
  * random shift (RS) helps to show the effects of interspecific associations after
  removing the effects of intraspecific aggregations on observed (realized)
  coexistence relationships

## Installation from the source

You can install the released version of ComSpat from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ComSpat")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/jamestsakalos/ComSpat) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jamestsakalos/ComSpat")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the main ComSpat function:

```{r example}
library(ComSpat)

data("grid.random") #input data frame
data("param.grid") #input paramater data frame
temp<-ComSpat(data = grid.random, params = param.grid[1:5,], dim_max = 64, type = "Grid")

```

The package’s vignette provides detailed explanation and demonstration on
the application of ComSpat.
