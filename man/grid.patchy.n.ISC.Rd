\title{Patchy no ISC grid data}
\format{
A data frame with 1551 species observations on the following three
variables.
\describe{
   \item{X}{X coordinates}
   \item{Y}{Y coordinates}
   \item{Species}{Species}}
}
\usage{
grid.patchy.n.ISC
}
\description{
The package contains three grid data sets. The grid data sets
(64 Ã— 64 sampling units) feature one simulation (grid.patchy.associated)
and two simulation derivatives (grid.random and grid.n.ISC) have been
produced by randomization. A spatially explicit individual-based simulation
model (PATPRO) was selected to produce a realistic grid community pattern
(\code{grid.patchy}) and features interspecific and intraspecific spatial
dependence due to simulated abiotic and biotic interactions. The
(\code{grid.random}) and (\code{grid.patchy.n.ISC}) data sets were produced
by CSR and RS randomizations of the original simulation (\code{grid.patchy})
. The (\code{grid.patchy.n.ISC}) data set only features intraspecific
spatial dependence; interspecific relationships were removed by
randomizations. The (\code{grid.random}) data set only features random
distributions; both intra- and interspecific relationships were removed by
randomizations.

\details{
The \code{X} and \code{Y} coordinates refer to the sampling unit of
the species in the sampling universe.
