\title{Transect grassland trait data}
\format{
A data frame with 713 species observations on the following two
variables.
\describe{
   \item{X}{X coordinates}
   \item{Species}{Species. Note that for the Transect grassland trait data,
   'Species' referes to plant functional type.}}
}
\usage{
tran.grass.t
}
\description{
The package contains two real transects with data sampled in open
sand grassland in Hungary (Bartha et al. 2008). These real transect data
sets were derived from Bartha et al.â€™s (2008) long-term study on the effect
of climate change on the interannual variability of grassland communities.
The transect data sets represent: (1) the spatial pattern data of frequent
species (species with more than 25 presences along the transect)
selected as a threshold from standard textbooks; \code{tran.grass.s}), and
(2) the spatial pattern data of plant functional types (PFTs) (in this case
data of species which belong to the same functional groups were merged;
\code{tran.grass.t}). These data represent the same transect and same
community; however, for merging species, all data were used (i.e. the data
of rare species were also considered within the particular PFT). For
simplicity, we have only selected a 25 m example with a very typical pattern;
this extent (transect length) is already representative of the community
pattern.

\details{
The \code{X} refers to the sampling unit of the species in the
sampling universe.
